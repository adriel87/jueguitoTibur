# Roll a Ball Project

In this practice we are going to create a game with a ball in Unity. Specifically this game consists of the following:

1. Scene whit the menu, contain 2 button
  - one button go to the tutorial
  - another button go to the level 1
2. Scene `tutorial`
  - in this scene we learn how to move the ball
3. Scene `level one`
  - in this scene we can jump and collect another type of token for improve our velocity

## Getting Started 🚀

  - Completing the tutorial hosted on the Unity platform.
  - Researching to add new elements in the game, such as jumping, swapping between scenes, adding textures....
